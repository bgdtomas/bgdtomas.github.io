          <h1>How much does it hurt to get a tattoo?</h1>
          <p>
            This is the question that all of us who go to get tattoos for the
            first time ask ourselves. Does it hurt? It depends. We are aware
            that many people do not get tattoos for fear of pain, but the
            sensation of the needle on the skin varies in each one. There are
            areas of the body that are more painful, as happens depending on the
            size of the tattoo. In addition, depending on the level of body fat,
            the pain will be more or less intense. If the area in which we are
            going to tattoo is bone, the pain will be more intense, if not, the
            sensation will be similar to a tingling. In this line, it is
            important to bear in mind that each person does not bear pain the
            same, so until you decide to get a tattoo you will not know what the
            feeling is that awaits you.

          <h1>What is the price of a tattoo?</h1>
          <p>
            In order to evaluate and budget your idea, I need the following
            information: Idea about the tattoo (Being as detailed as possible)
            <br />
            Approximate size in centimeters
            <br />
            Place/space on your body where the tattoo will go
            <br />
            If necessary, attach a photo or reference image of both the idea and
            the area to be tattooed
          </p>
        </article>
        <article id="faq" class="text faq fade qnaText">
          <h1>Are there areas to get tattoos that are better than others?</h1>
          <p>
            It all depends on the approach we want to give it. There is pain,
            visibility and aging. Three factors that we have to take into
            account when choosing an area. Along with this, we must start from
            the fact that there will be areas that have to be reviewed
            frequently, which can also increase the price that we set ourselves
            at first. Our recommendations, despite being something personal, are
            that you opt for areas that have less visibility, since factors such
            as the sun or constant friction will cause the tattoo to lose
            quality over time and that you have to review it again.

            What if I have any kind of allergy? Is it something that you have in
            mind?

          <p>
            Before deciding to tattoo a person, we take care of solving any of
            the doubts, fears or concerns that may arise. It is important that,
            if you have skin problems, any type of allergy or medical problems,
            you let us know so that we can offer you the best solution.
